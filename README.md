# blocksearch-iccprt

This script can be used to search a particular block/parameter of a block from all the compounds of a Schneider Foxboro DCS. Here, ICCPRT is used as the source of our database. Each ICCPRT file of a Control Processor (CP) is exported as a worksheet in one single excel file. For example, if there are 10 CP's in the network, each CP will have its ICCPRT worksheet. 

In [convertData.ipynb](https://github.com/faseelmo/blocksearch-iccprt/blob/main/convertData.ipynb), each block information is extracted from the excel database and arranged in a pandas DataFrame.  

The above DataFrame needs to be saved as a csv file to run [search.ipynb](https://github.com/faseelmo/blocksearch-iccprt/blob/main/search.ipynb). 

An alternative method to cleanup/sort iccprt data is shown in [convertDatav2.ipynb](https://github.com/faseelmo/blocksearch-iccprt/blob/main/convertDatav2.ipynb). Here the complete raw iccprt data (of all cp's) are in a single .txt file. Please note that this file is not fully optimized for search.ipynb and therefore users can expect errors when searching through the CSV generated by convertDatav2.ipynb. However, this can be easily fixed if convertData.ipynb is used as a reference.
